Liability Information
---------------------

You should customize [this waiver](https://github.com/CollHome/collhome-resources/blob/master/Start%20a%20CollHome/Liability%20information/Standard%20Liability%20Waiver%20Release%20Form.pdf) for your chapter and have it
read over by your University's legal department before using it.

A liability wavier cannot protect you from charges of gross negligence.

Well-funded chapters should consider surety bonds or insurance instead.
