#Community Engagement
There are so many ways to reach out to the community and get caregivers interested!


##Flyer!
Make awesome and creative flyers to hang around town with your chapter’s information to get people interested.  Hang them around town in public places and in doctor’s offices.  Reach out to local advertising websites and groups that post local services and events on social media.


##Get in Touch with Existing Organizations!
There are so many awesome organizations that are already dedicated to caregiving and supporting caregivers.  Below is a list of a few well known ones, but you would be surprised the information a quick Google search can provide about what already exists in your area!

##Maintain Good Relationships with Caregivers and Their Loved Ones!
Word of mouth is a great way to spread awareness about your chapter and the services you provide.  People are more likely to tell their friends and family about their experiences if they continue to be memorable and positive.  It is really important to foster continuous and good relationships with the caregivers and those they care for as this is the whole premise for the founding of this organization!


##Social Media!
It’s the age of the internet and social media and you should use that to your advantage!  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so many more are great for advertising your organization and connecting with the greater community.  Create social media accounts and pages for your chapter and make sure it stays up to date and is active!
