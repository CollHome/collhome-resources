# Welcome To CollHome

If you're seeing this, you have probably just started a brand new CollHome chapter at your local College or University. Congratulations, you are now part of a movement which betters individuals and communities while improving the lives of many. Now that you're a member, here are some resources that can help you get your chapter off the ground.

In this folder you will find information on best practices for Community Engagement, a template first constitution document, advice on ways to fundraise, strategies to increase the size of your group, legal information like liability waivers, and guides for teaching and training aspiring care helpers.
