# Fundraising

Some caregivers and care recipients are under extreme financial strain, and providing support that is easy and inexpensive can be an enourmously helpful way to reduce their stress. Because of this, chapters aim to subsidize or eliminate costs of products wherever possible. Below is helpful information that can be utilized by chapters to raise funds and reduce costs. It is highly encouraged that chapters also look locally for resources specific to their own communities to aid in this process.

**University Programs**

Many universities have community outreach programs which provide resources and/or funding for projects that serve groups and individuals in need in the surrounding neighborhoods. Search your website and reach out to faculty to find out more and see if CollHome qualifies. Some of these programs require an application to explain the initiative requesting funds and how they will be allocated.

**Sponsorships**

Another way to subsidize costs is to reach out to local and regional businesses that would be willing to support your organization, or pay for individual products. The best way to contact them is to find the email address of an individual that works for the company and to send them a sponsorship letter. [Here is an example letter that can be used to begin a dialogue with those companies.](https://github.com/CollHome/collhome-resources/blob/master/Start%20a%20CollHome/Fundraising/Sponsorship%20Letter%20Template)

**Fundraising Initiatives**

In the end CollHome is all about learning from, and improving the lives of members of each chapter's community. In that vein, creating fundraising initiatives that engage with those communities are a great way to both raise funds and spread awareness for the chapter. Examples of initiatives include carwashes, bakesales, profit shares, and letter campaigns.
