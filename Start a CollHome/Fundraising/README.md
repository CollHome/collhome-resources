# Fundraising

Some caregivers and care recipients are under extreme financial strain, and providing support that is easy and inexpensive can be an enourmously helpful way to reduce their stress. Because of this, chapters aim to subsidize or eliminate costs of products wherever possible. Below is helpful information that can be utilized by chapters to raise funds and reduce costs. It is highly encouraged that chapters also look locally for resources specific to their own communities to aid in this process.

Many universities have community outreach programs which provide resources and/or funding for projects that serve groups and individuals in need in the surrounding neighborhoods. Search your website and reach out to faculty to find out more and see if CollHome qualifies. Some of these programs require an application to explain the initiative requesting funds and how they will be allocated.
