Who are we? 
We are a student run volunteer organization devoted to helping caregivers and their loved ones. We use our technological expertise to create and install personalized smart home device plans leveraging existing products. We provide resources on common use cases that can be customized to caregiverâ€™s needs. Our goal is to give caregivers peace of mind through our continuous support. Through this organization, college students connect with their greater communities and prepare to become caregivers themselves.
The Project 
Some caregivers and care recipients are under extreme financial strain, and providing support that is easy and inexpensive can be an enourmously helpful way to reduce their stress. Because of this, chapters aim to subsidize or eliminate costs of products wherever possible. Below is helpful information that can be utilized by chapters to raise funds and reduce costs. It is highly encouraged that chapters also look locally for resources specific to their own communities to aid in this process.
