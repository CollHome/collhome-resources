**Medication Management**

Tools to manage medicationare essential to maintain the peace of mind of
caregivers whose loved ones must manage strict medication regiments but whose
memories may no longer be cut out for such complex tasks.

 1) Smart pill boxes like the [Tricella Liif](../../Product%20Guides/Tricella%20Liif)
 can track when the loved one is taking their medication and notify family members
 when pills are not taken or when the wrong pill is taken

 2) Skills for [Google Home](../../Product%20Guides/Google%20Home) exist to
 help remind loved ones to take medication, though they often require interaction
 and so can be less effective if the loved one does not remember to ask the
 assisant which pills should be taken
