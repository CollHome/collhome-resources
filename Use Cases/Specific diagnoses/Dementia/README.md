**Dementia**

The effects of dementia can be varied and needs are unique to individuals. CollHome volunteers should seek to thoroughly understand the capabilities, limitations, and needs of the individual they are working with. Below we suggest a few strategies that have been shown to work in addressing the needs of some individuals with dementia.

**1) [Tracking sleep patterns](../product_guides/Fitbit.md)**
        Tracking sleep patterns is very important for some individuals with dementia. Caregivers are sometimes tasked with keeping up with sleep patterns by their loved ones doctors in order to track the progress of their dementia. This can be extremely demanding on caregivers and can be eased by a number of technology tools. Use of these tools usually requires some comfort with technology and instruction/demonstration from CollHome volunteers will likely be helpful. 

**2) [Making Calls](../product_guides/Google_Home.md)**
        Cellular communication is often really important for caregivers, yet can present challenges due to simple things like misplacing a phone or forgetting a number. Smart home hubs present simple and reliable calling functionality via voice. CollHome volunteers should make sure to test and demonstrate its use.

**3) [Power off devices](../product_guides/wemo)**
        Dementia can cause devices to be left on which can be dangerous, expensive, and wasteful. Smart wall sockets can be set up to automatically turn off devices after specified amounts of time. CollHome volunteers should be careful to avoid installation in a way that would result in unexpected shut off of devices.
