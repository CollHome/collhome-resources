# Consultation Interview
### How to understand what your caregivers need

You should take three people to the interview.
Two people should ask questions and the last one should take notes.

It should be very conversational, you should ask deeper questions
based on what they say.

Having a fuller picture of the problems facing caregivers is useful,
even if we can't solve all thier problems.

You should come back to group with notes on meeting to plan how best to outfit
the home of the care recipient.

### Where to Meet
Not in their houses unless they're confortable with that.
Otherwise, you should meet in a public area.
Have them bring pictures so we have a sense of what we're working with

### Sample Questions
* Tell us about your caregiving story
* Walk us through your average day.
* What do you have the most trouble doing at home right now?
* What tasks are the most difficult for the person you are caring for?
* Tell us about the person you caregive for?
* Ask about ability to use different types of interfaces
* What areas of the house do they spend the most time in?

#### Technology
* What is your comfort with technology? What is the person you are caring for's
comfort with technology?
* What interfaces can your care recipient use? Voice? Touch? etc.
* Do you have Wifi?
	* If you don't, would you be comfortable getting it and paying for it?
* Android vs. iOS

Things that let the care recipient be more independent, or things that make
monitoring them more efficient.
